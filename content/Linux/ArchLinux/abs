Arch Build System
=================================================

Ports : system consisting of build scripts that reside in 
 a directory tree on the local system.

 Simply put, each port contains a script within a directory
 intuitively named after the installable third-party app.


ABS

The ABS tree offers the same functionality by providing build scripts
called PKGBUILDS, which are populated with info for a given 
piece of software: integrity, hashes, project URL, version, license, build instructions.

These PKGBUILDS are later parsed by 'makepkg', the actual program that generates packages 
cleanly manageable by 'pacman'.
