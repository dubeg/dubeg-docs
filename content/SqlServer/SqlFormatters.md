- ApexSQL
    + SSMS add-in.
    + Missing formatting options.

- SQL Assistant
    + Standalone, and SSMS add-in.
    + Absolutely lacking in formatting options.

- dbForce SQL Complete
    + SSMS add-in.
    + Free (limited func?).
    + Very good.
        - Missing one or two settings, 
          but overall I'm satisfied.

- dpriver SQL Pretty printer
    + Owned.
    + Missing formatting options.

- RedGate SQL Prompt 
    + Pretty good, but not as good as dbForce.

- SSMS Boost
    + Has potential, but the way to experiment with formatting options
      is pretty shitty.
