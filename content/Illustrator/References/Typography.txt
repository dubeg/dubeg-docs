		Font Choices
		-
		Web fonts from sources like FontSquirrel, or the standard fonts that come with Mac/Windows system.

		For system fonts, there is some parity between the two. Choosing a font that both system have will ensure a similar experience no matter the platform.

		Font Type Rendering
		-
		Factors: 
			* Computer Platform
			* Browser Rendering Engine
			* Screen resolution
			* Typeface Quality

		Many variables, so it's hard to replicate or trust that the font will render in the different browsers as it does in Ai.

		That being said, in Ai, you can set the anti-aliasing method of the typeface in-use to get better results for types destined for the web or mobile devices. 

			1. Use the Selection tool.
			2. Select text.
			3. Click the "character" link in the control panel (i.e. tool pnl).
			4. Bottom right corner of the Character panel, there's a dropdown list of Anti-Aliasing methods (a.k.a. "Methode de lissage").

			Note: according to the author, the "crisp" setting will give you better results on average.


		Typesetting Basics
		-

		Using Point Type
			Using the Type tool, click once and type away.
			When finished typing, press Escape to exit editing mode.

			Note: using point type as opposed to area type for horizontal navigation elements gives you more flexibility in moving, aligning, and spacing the individual blocks of type.

			Tip: select new text elements and pick the eyedropper tool. Then click on an existing text element to copy its text attributes on to the selected elements.
