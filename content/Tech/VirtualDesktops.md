- Does SublimeText support Mission Control spaces?
    


## Mission Control
+ User can assign an app to a space, such so that it will always open in that space.
+ Options
    + All Desktops
    + This Desktop
    + Desktop on Display

By default, when switching to an app, the desktop automatically switches to a space that has open windows for the app. For example, if you create a new TextEdit document in Desktop 3, but TextEdit windows are already open in Desktop 2, your new document opens in Desktop 2. To change this setting, choose Apple menu  > System Preferences, click Mission Control, then deselect the checkbox for switching.

Spaces has been around since macOS 10.5, but it still feels unfinished. It never got full API support in Cocoa, so applications canâ€™t really control which spaces their windows appear on, and neither can scripts. The system decides where new windows will appear, and you have to live with it.
