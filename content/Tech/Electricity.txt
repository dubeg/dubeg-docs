# Guide to amperes and watts

Current
- organized flow of electric charges through a conductor.
- measured as a rate at a point in time (?)
- measured in ampere units, _A_.
- abbreviated _I_.

Resistance
- without resistance, current flows freely (without much friction or blockage).
- resistance greatly reduces the current flowing in a circuit.
- measured in Ohm units.
- abbreviated _R_.

Ground
- common return path for electric current, or
- reference point from which voltages are measured, or
- direct physical connection to the Earth.
- Functions of grounding to earth
  + prevent user contact with dangerous voltage when electrical insulation fails.
  + limits build-up of static electricity
- a ground is considered as a infinite source or sink for charge,
  which can absorb an unlimited amount of current without changing its potential.
- The term ground is so common in circuits that mobile devices, vehicles are said to have a ground connection
  without any actual connection to earth, despite "common" being a more appropriate term for such
  a connection. It is usally a large conductor attached to one side of the power supply,
  which serves as the common return path for current from many different components in the circuit.

Voltage
- driving force that pushes electric charges to create current.
- also called electric potential difference, or tension, or pressure.
- measured between two points in a circuit.
- measured in volt units, _V_.
- abbreviated _E_.
- V = I x R = voltage equals current times resistance.

Power
- work done by an electric circuit.
- measured in watt units, _W_.
- abbreviated _P_.
- P = E x I = power equals voltage times current

Electric potential difference
- difference of charge between two points

Electric current, in and of itself, isnâ€™t all that useful. 
It becomes useful only when the energy carried by an electric current 
is converted into some other form of energy, such as heat, light, sound, or radio waves. 

---------------

Volt
- one volt is the amount of electromotive force necessary to do one watt of work at one ampere of current.
- one volt = 1 joule / 1 coulomb.

Amp
- one amp is the current equal to one coulomb per second.
- coulomb is derived unit. 1C = 1 A x 1s.

Watt
- one watt is the amount of work done by a circuit in which one ampere of current is driven by one volt.

Coulomb
- one coulomb is the charge transported by a constant current of 1 amp in one second.

Components of a circuit
- conductors
- insulators
- resistors
- transistors
- capacitors

Other Keywords
- dissipation: heat
- polarity
- integrated circuits
- Direct current (DC)
  + current which flows in one direction.
  + each electron completes the cycle of a circuit
- Alternating current (AC)
  + oscillating electrons? or moving in relatively short distance, back and forth.
  + current which preriodically reverses direction.
- AC/DC power adapters
  + AC input, ex: 120V AC outlet at home)
  + DC output
- Transformer (for AC)
- Alternator (for AC)
  + produces alternating current.

## Questions
In alternating current, are electrons going from one point to another? No.

There must be a loss of electrons somewhere in an AC circuit,
by devices consuming from the AC circuit. How does the circuit gains new electrons
if it is well insulated?  

How is AC converted into DC?

How do AC adapters work?

Why can we see colors but not UVs?

## AC adapter
- rectifier
- diodes
    + component that allow current to pass in one direction, but not the other.

## Physical factors of current
- Size of wire (diameter, or area)
- Length of wire
- Resistance of wire material
- Insulation
