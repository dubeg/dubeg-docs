# Colors

HSV
Hue:        Color
Brightness: Amount of white|black in a color. ( 100 % = white )
Saturation: Amount of gray in a color.  ( 0 = mostly gray)


## Cylindrical-coordinate representations of points in an RGB color model
HSL and HSV rearrange the geometry of RGB in an attempt to be more intuitive 
and perceptually relevant than the cartesian representation.


### HSL and HSV
HSL
   * Hue
   * Saturation
   * Lightness

HSV (aka HSB) (used by Photoshop) (developed in mid-1970s)
   * Hue
   * Saturation
   * Value | Brightness

HSI
   * Hue
   * Saturation
   * Intensity

In each cylinder, the.. 
- angle around the central vertical axis corresponds to "hue",
- distance from the axis corresponds to 'saturation',
- distance long the axis corresponds to 'value' | 'intensity' | 'lightness'.

Hue is the same attribute in both models.
Saturation has a different meaning in both:
    In HSV:  


# Motivation
Most displays produce colors by combining red, green and blue light in varying intensity.
The resulting mixtures in RGB color space can reproduce a wide variety of colors (called a gamut).
However, the relationship between the constituent amounts of r,g,b light and the resulting color is unintuitive.

HSL was based more upon how colors are organized and conceptualized in human vision in terms of other color-making attributes, 
such as hue, lightness, and chroma;as well as upon traditional color mixing methods 
– e.g., in painting – that involve mixing brightly colored pigments with black or white to achieve lighter, darker, or less colorful colors.

## Color Making attributes
The dimensions of the HSV and HSL geometries – simple transformations of the not-perceptually-based RGB model – 
are not directly related to the photometric color-making attributes of the same names, as defined by scientists such as the CIE or ASTM. 
Nonetheless, it is worth reviewing those definitions before leaping into the derivation of our models.

Hue
    The "attribute of a visual sensation according to which an area appears to be similar to one of the perceived colors: red, yellow, green, and blue, or to a combination of two of them" 
Intensity, radiance
    Total amount of light passing through a particular area.
Luminance
    The radiance weighted by the effect of each wavelength on a typical human observer.
Luma
    The weighted sum of gamma-corrected R′, G′, and B′ values, and used in Y′CbCr, for JPEG compression and video transmission.
Brightness
    The "attribute of a visual sensation according to which an area appears to emit more or less light".
Lightness, value
    The "brightness relative to the brightness of a similarly illuminated white".
Colorfulness
    The "attribute of a visual sensation according to which the perceived color of an area appears to be more or less chromatic".
Chroma
    The "colorfulness relative to the brightness of a similarly illuminated white".
Saturation
    The "colorfulness of a stimulus relative to its own brightness".

Brightness and colorfulness are absolute measures, which usually describe the spectral distribution of light entering the eye, 
while lightness and chroma are measured relative to some white point, and are thus often used for descriptions of surface colors, 
remaining roughly constant even as brightness and colorfulness change with different illumination. 
Saturation can be defined as either the ratio of colorfulness to brightness or of chroma to lightness.
