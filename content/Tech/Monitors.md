Panels
------

### TN
Twisted nematic.

- Fast pixel response.
- Fast refresh rate.
- Prone to color shifting when viewed at an angle.

### VA
Vertical alignment.

- High native-contrast ratio
- Robust color support
- Ability to display deep blacks
- Noticeable ghosting effects


### IPS
In-plane switching.

- Best color quality
- Strong grayscale performance
- Wide viewing angles
- Slower pixel response than TN's.
- Subject to motion artifacts.



Pixel response
--------------

__Gray-to-gray (g2g)__  

- Signifies the time it takes a pixel to transition from one shade of gray to another.
- A low pixel response will helpe eliminate the smearing of moving images and provide a smooth overall picture.
- A g2g response of 2ms and less is ideal.
- A g2g response of 4ms is adequate. 



Contrast
-------------
Higher is better.

- Low: 200:1 
- Common: 1000:1
- Good: 2000:1 
- Dynamic ratio doesn't mean much.
- Basically all TN/IPS advertise 1000:1.
