By default, Windows 10 doesn't give you the ability to specify a custom resolution for your device.
Previously, there had been regedit modifications that would add a preset list of resolutions to Windows to work around that.

Nowadays, however, there's a program called __Intel Graphics Command Center__ (and surely an AMD equivalent) that can do the task well enough.
