Custom User Interface
---------------------
GPO (exists in Windows 10, in Enterprise and Pro editions)
```
User Configuration\Administrative Templates\System\Custom User Interface
```

Registry:
```
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System
	(Default) REG_SZ: C:\Program Files\Internet Explorer\iexplore.exe -k www.google.de
```

- If the "System" key doesn't exist, create it. 
- Since this is in the "Current User" hive, it will only affect the currently logged user.





Shell Launcher
----------------
Use Shell Launcher to replace the default Windows 10 shell with a custom shell. It can be any application or executable as our custom shell, such as a command window or a custom dedicated application, can also configure Shell Launcher to launch different shell applications for different users or user groups.

- Can launch different shell applications for different users or groups.

- Can't launch a Universal Windows app.
	* Using ShellLauncher V1.
	* Using ShellLauncher V2, you can specify a Universal Windows app as a custom shell.

- Can't use an application that launches a different process and exits as a custom shell.
	* ShellLauncher monitors the process to identify when the custom shell exits.

- Can't configure both ShellLauncher and AssignedAccess on the same system.

- Command string length has a maximum length of 128 characters.
	+ True or false?

- Run and RunOnce registry keys are processed before starting the custom shell, so your custom shell doesnâ€™t need to handle the automatic startup of other applications and services.

- Behavior of the system when your custom shell exits is handled by ShellLauncher. 
	+ Can configure the shell exit behavior if the default behavior does not meet your needs.

- Different names
	+ Embedded Shell Launcher: name of feature in Windows 10 v1511.
	+ Custom Shell Launcher: name of feature in Windows 10 v1607+.

- Not turned on by default in Windows.
