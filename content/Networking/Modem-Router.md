# Modem vs. router
Both devices server a difference purpose. A router is a small box that allows multiple computers to join the same network.

While early routers provided several Ethernet ports for wired connections, most modern routers offer wireless connectivity as well.

While connecting to a router provides access to a local network (LAN), it doesnt necessarily provide access to the internet. In order for devices on the network to connect to the internet, the router must be connected to a modem. Therefore, most routers have a specific Ethernet port that's designed to connect to the Ethernet port of a cable/DSL modem.

A modem is a device that provides access to the internet. The modem connects to the ISP, which typically provides either cable or DSL Internet service. Cable modems have a coaxial connnection, which is the same type of connector found on a TV/Cable box. DSL modems have a telephone connector.

By connecting a modem to the router, all devices connected to the router can access the modem and its Internet connection. The router provides a local IP address to each connected device, but they will all have the same external IP address, assigned by the ISP.
