Network: any collection of computers that exchange information with each other.


## Local Area Networks (LANs)
LANs are usually confined to a limited geographic area.
- Single building
- Campus


## Wide Area Networks (WANs)
Wide area networking combines multiple LANs that are geographically separate.

- Accomplished by connecting LANs with dedicated lines such as..
   + T1, T3, 
   + dial-up phone,
   + satellite links
   + data packet carrier services
- WANs can be as simple as a modem and a remote access server, or ...

## Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs)
- Uses radio frequency (RF) technology to transmit/receive data.
- The IEEE developed 802.11 specification for wireless LAN technology.
   + Specifices over-the-air interface between client/base, or 2 clients.
   + Specifices security protocols
      * WEP : Wire Equivalent Privacy
         - Provides encryption over radio waves from end point to end point.
      * WPA : Wi-Fi Protected Access
         - Is an upgrade over WEP.
         - Works with WEP-enbled products.
         - Two key improvements:
            + improved data encryption through the temporal key integrity protocol (TKIP)
            + user authentification with the extensible authentification protocol (EAP)

Wireless Protocols
a. 802.11                     | 1/2 Mbps in 2.4GHz
b. 802.11a                    | 54 Mbps in 5GHz
c. 802.11b/High rate/Wi-Fi    | 11 Mbps in 2.4GHz
d. 802.11g/Wi-Fi              | 54 Mbps in 2.4GHz


## The Internet
The largest network of all.

- Decentralized system of linked networks, worldwide
- Faciliates data communication services
   + Remote login
   + File transfer
   + E-mail
   + WWW
   + Newsgroups
- Operates on a three (3)-level hierarchy
   + Backbone networks
   + Mid-level networks
   + Stub networks

## Intranet 
A secure Internet-like network for organizations.
With advancements in brower-based software for the Internet, many private organizations have implemented intranets.

- A private network utilizing Internet-type tools.
- Restricted within that organization.
- May provide easy access to corporate information.

## Extranet
A secure means for sharing information with partners.
While an internet is used to disseminate confidential information within a corporation, an extranet is used to share data in a secure fashion with business partners.

- Internet-type tools are used by content providers to update the extranet.
- Features
   + Encryption
   + User authentification

## Type of LAN technology
- Ethernet
- Fast ethernet
- Gigabit ethernet
- 10 gigabit ethernet
- Asynchronous transfer mode (ATM)
- Power over ethernet (PoE)
- Token ring

### Ethernet
Most popular physical layer LAN technology.
It defines
   - the number of conductors required for a connection.
   - the performance threshold that can be expected
   - the framework for data transmission

Speed: up to 10 Mbps
Spec: IEEE 802.3

### Fast Ethernet
Speed: up to 100 Mbps
Spec: IEEE 802.3u

### Gigabit Ethernet
Speed: 1 Gbit/s
Spec: IEEE 802.3
Gigabit over copper

### 10 Gigabit Ethernet
Speed: 10 Gbits/s
Spec: IEEE 802.3ae
Designed for use with optical fiber.
