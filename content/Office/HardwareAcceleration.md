- Turn off hardware acceleration in Excel if you encounter lag issues.
- If you still experience poor performance without H. A., try setting the battery power mode to `Best Performance`.

On both a Surface Book 2 and Dell Latitude 5500, scrolling using a mouse (in a sheet with many items) would be very laggy, for whatever reason. The weird thing is that scrolling using the touchpad is dramatically better.

Whatever the reason, I'll wait to have a device with a more capable iGPU before re-enabling this option.
