# Outlook for iOS

## Contacts
- Global Address List
	+ Only able to access it via performing a search in Outlook (magnifying glass).
	+ No listing possible, unless after manually copying entries from the GAL to your contacts.
- Add the shared mailbox to access existing contacts.
	+ If the Outlook setting "Enregistrer dans les contacts" is enabled:
		- Contacts will be saved to the iOS Contacts app.
		- Remember: can't sync back contacts (new, changes) from the iOS Contacts app to Exchange.
			+ On-way sync from Exchange to iOS Contacts.
			+ In Android, however, it's two-way sync.

## Calendars
- Sync of calendars between Outlook and native Calendar app requires iCloud (?).
- Can manage Exchange calendar within Outlook.
